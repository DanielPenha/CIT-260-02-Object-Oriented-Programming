/*  W03 Assignment: Program 3.2
    Write a short Java program that does the following:

    Tells the user what the program does.
    Prompts the user to enter a year.
    Gets the user's input and saves it.
    Prompts the user to enter a value for the month(1 = Jan, 2 = Feb, etc).
    Gets the user's input and saves it. If the value is is not between 1 and 12 inclusive, tell the user and terminate the program.
    Calculates the number of days in that month. Your program should correctly handle leap years (see listing 3.7 in the textbook).
    Displays the number of days in that month.
    Outputs a goodbye message.

    *************************************************************************
    Here are some examples of what your program should look like when it runs (user input is in green):
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given a year and a month in that year, this program will tell you
    the number of days in that month.
    Enter a year: 1953
    Enter a value for the month(1 = Jan, 2 = Feb, etc): 3

    March of 1953 has 31 days in it.
    Goodbye.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given a year and a month in that year, this program will tell you
    the number of days in that month.
    Enter a year: 2020
    Enter a value for the month(1 = Jan, 2 = Feb, etc): 13

    13 is invalid. Month values must be between between 1 and 12, inclusive.
    Goodbye.
